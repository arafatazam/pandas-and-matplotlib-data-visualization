# Visualization using matplotlib

This repository demonstrates data visualization using **matplotlib** library. I have taken the data from https://www.data.gov.uk/dataset/76bda24c-7793-407c-8430-7cb69039e9b7/average-age-of-the-population-by-ethnicity

I have used **pandas** for reading and cleaning the data and **numpy** for calculation. Please run the file from anaconda environment otherwise dependent libraries needed to be installed from **pip**.
